        Welcome to this amazing site.
        We are 2 students from LTU whom are doing this website to learn about dynamic web applications (course code M7011E).

        
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
        Here in the North of Sweden we have an old tradition of riding "breadbaskets" down stairs.
        This because we can't ride sleds in the 2 months of summer we have ;(.
        So we are DIBP (Datasektionens Internationella BrödbaksSällskap).
        We are creating a social site that let riders share their experience.
        Rating stairs and sharing tips on the best stairs on the university.</p>
