Course: M7011E 2014
==========

In this course we got to start from scratch and decide what technologies we wanted to use and what to create.

We decided to create a dynamic webapplication(facebook like) where you could upload spots, photos, comments and rank these spots.

This application is built with Golang, HTML 5 and Javascript.
